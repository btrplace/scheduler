0.37 - 14 Apr 2014
----------------------
- minor bug fixes
- refactor choco.actionModel to choco.transition. Now xActionModel classes are xTransition classes.
  The TransitionFactory allows to plug your own classes to model transitions (issue #37)

version 0.35 - 18 Feb 2014
----------------------
- Move to choco 3. The scalability will be affected temporary but choco 2 is no longer maintained
- The variable labelling is now inferred from the verbosity level (#27)
- Simplify the signature of constraints to reduce the signature to the minimum needed (#29)

version 0.34 - 26 Nov 2013
----------------------
- Update dependencies

version 0.32 - 12 Sep 2013
----------------------
- Bugs fix.
- Reduce the memory footprint of classes in the model package.
- [StaticPartitioning](http://btrp.inria.fr/apidocs/releases/btrplace/solver/last/index.html?btrplace/solver/choco/runner/staticPartitioning/StaticPartitioning.html):
   an experimental partitioning algorithm that splits problem from disjoint set of nodes
- API changes in Model, Instance, Mapping
- new constraint: [MaxOnline](http://btrp.inria.fr/apidocs/releases/btrplace/solver/last/index.html?btrplace/model/constraint/MaxOnline.html)
- API changes due to spell checking

version 0.31 - 16 Jul 2013
----------------------
- Bugs fix
- Optimization constraint is now a part of a reconfiguration algorithm
  at the API level
- It is possible to specify a dedicated solving method using InstanceSolver.
  This will be used later to integrate the parallel resolution of partitioned
  instances.


version 0.30 - 04 Jun 2013
----------------------
- Bugs fix
- Close #16, #18, #19
- MAJOR API change: Type system for elements. No more UUIDS.

version 0.29 - 07 May 2013
----------------------
- Multiple Bug fixes
- Fix regressions in the placement subProblems that appeared in 0.28
- Complete the forgeVM model. It is now required to declare
  a template for the VMs to forge using a "template" attribute
  in the model
- Fix bugs reported in #5, #10, #13, #14
- Full support VM relocation through a re-instantiation. BtrPlace can
  now infer if live-migration is preferable over re-instantiation.
- Refactor completely the "satisfaction" process. Now everything takes place
  inside a SatConstraintChecker.
- Move most of the interface and abstract classes to the package of their
  implementations

version 0.28 - 29 Mar 2013
----------------------
- migration to JDK 7
- much better performance for both the placement and the scheduling part
- bug fixes

  moment the servers are powered up and down
